# College Basketball 2021 Case study üèÄ

This is an independent final project I've performed for BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics Applications in Business.

I chose this dataset because of my interest in basketball. I normally watch more NBA than I do college, but March Madness this year has peaked an interest that Illinois has not experienced since 2004/2005, so I felt this dataset would be interesting to take a look at.
